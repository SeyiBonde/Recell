# Recell
Buying and selling used phones and tablets used to be something that happened on a handful of online marketplace sites but the used and refurbished device market has grown considerably over the past decade.

Refurbished and used devices continue to provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing one. Recell, a start up is looking to help in maximizing the longevity of devices through second-hand trade. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may further boost this segment as consumers cut back on discretionary spending and buy phones and tablets only for immediate needs.

 

## Objective

The rising potential of this comparatively under-the-radar market fuels the need for an ML-based solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices. ReCell, aiming to tap the potential in this market,needs a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it.
